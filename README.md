# Reaper-Tools

A collection of scripts developed with the help of AI, providing handy tools and utilities for enhancing productivity in Reaper.

## Tools Included

The following tools are included in this repository:

### Track Batch Reformat

This script allows you to format the names of selected tracks in various ways: title case, upper case, or lower case. It presents a dialog to the user to select the desired format option, ensuring more consistent and professional-looking track naming.

### Track Batch Renamer

This powerful renaming tool provides a range of options to update the names of selected tracks. Features include prefix/suffix addition, find/replace functionality, use of wildcards, and track numbering. This tool is perfect for large projects with many tracks that require systematic naming.

### Track Renamer Lite

A simplified track renaming script that prompts the user for a new track name and applies it to all selected tracks. This is a quick and easy way to update the names of multiple tracks at once.

### Track Numbering

This script enumerates selected tracks, appending a unique number to the end of each track name. This is particularly useful for projects where you have multiple similar tracks (e.g., takes or layers), and you want to easily distinguish between them.
